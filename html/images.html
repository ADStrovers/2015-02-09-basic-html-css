  <h1>Images</h1>
  <p>Images can be inserted into an HTML file using the img tag.</p>
  <p>It is highly suggested to use an alt attribute to assign a text description to images in case a browser is slow at loading a text or 
    in the case of trying to optimize search engine results as crawlers cannot read the image itself.</p>
  <p>The src attribute is also required of all img's as that is where the image is stored so it can be rendered to the client.</p>
    <img src="../images/cat1.jpeg" width="600" height="400" alt="Picture of a cat.">
