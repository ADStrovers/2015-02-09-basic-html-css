    <p>There are multiple types of lists within HTML.  Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists.  Alone they do almost nothing, however, once you give them the list items they become two seperate entities.</p>  
    <p>In one, the default is to number, or order, the list so that it has some type of heirarchy built into it, Ordered Lists.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Much</li>
      <li>Like</li>
      <li>This</li>
    </ol>  
    <p>While Unordered lists do not build in that heirachy instead focusing on just listing the items with bullets or points.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Such</li>
      <li>As</li>
      <li>This</li>
    </ul>
