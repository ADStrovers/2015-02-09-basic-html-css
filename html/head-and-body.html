    <p>Head and body are two very difference sections within an html documents.  Generally we can define the line between them as follows:</p>
    <p>Head: Information about the page that should not be rendered directly to the page.
      This can include things such as: meta-info, titles, javascript meant to be run before anything else, linking css file for formatting the HTML, etc.</p>

    <p>Body: This is where you put your content that should be rendered to the page.  The crunch of the webpage.</p>>
